# Real-Time Crash Detection and Emergency Response System
This project implements an AI-driven accident detection and automated emergency alert system using CCTV footage.  
A ResNet50 deep learning model identifies accident frames with high accuracy, while a MATLAB-based communication system ensures reliable delivery of alerts using adaptive modulation and Unequal Error Protection (UEP).  
A WhatsApp-based alert mechanism automatically notifies the nearest hospitals with an escalation logic that guarantees timely medical response.

## Accident Detection Model
Model: ResNet50 (ImageNet pretrained, fine-tuned)  
Dataset: Accident Detection from CCTV Footage  
Preprocessing: resizing to 224×224, normalization, augmentation  

### Training Setup
- Epochs: 35  
- Batch Size: 16  
- Optimizer: Adam (LR = 5e-5)  
- Loss: Cross-Entropy  
- Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau  

### Performance
Metric     | Score  
-----------|--------  
Accuracy   | 94.9%  
Precision  | 93%

## MATLAB-Based Emergency Alert Transmission
MATLAB simulates the reliability of alert transmission under noisy channel conditions.

### Techniques Used
- 16-QAM modulation  
- AWGN channel  
- Reed–Solomon UEP Coding  
  - High Priority: RS(255,223)  
  - Medium Priority: RS(127,111)  
  - Low Priority: RS(63,55)

### Key Results
- BER decreases from 2.6×10⁻¹ to 1×10⁻⁴ as SNR increases (0–20 dB)  
- High-priority alerts deliver near-perfect reliability for SNR > 18 dB  
- Robust communication even under high noise  

Plots are included in the results folder.

## WhatsApp Emergency Alert System
Emergency alerts include:
- Accident coordinates  
- Distance to each hospital  
- Time of detection  
- Alert category  

### Escalation Workflow
1. Alerts sent to the three nearest hospitals  
2. System waits for confirmation  
3. If a hospital accepts the case:  
   - Remaining hospitals receive a cancellation message  
4. If no hospital confirms:  
   - Alert escalates to a backup (fourth) hospital  

Screenshots are available in the alert_system/alert_screenshots folder.

## End-to-End Pipeline
1. Extract frames from CCTV footage  
2. ResNet50 detects accident frames  
3. MATLAB simulates alert transmission  
4. Python script sends WhatsApp alerts  
5. Confirmation or escalation ensures guaranteed medical dispatch
